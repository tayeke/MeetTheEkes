    <dd>
      <p>The only way to reach Orcas Island is via ferry from Anacortes, WA. It holds cars too, so that way you can have your car on the island with you. Reservations for the Anacortes ferry to Orcas Island must be made in advance and are available starting January 31 for our wedding date and can be found here.</p>
      <p class="bold">Getting to the ferry:</p>
      <p>From Seattle take I-5 north. Exit 230 onto Route 20 West. Route 20 begins as a two-lane road and travels through miles of farmland. It then turns into a four-lane road and crosses a long bridge onto Fidalgo Island. You will pass a casino and wind up and around into Anacortes. In town, Route 20 veers right onto Commercial Street. Stay on Commercial Street for four lights and then turn left at 12th street. There is a sign for the ferry with an arrow. It is well marked, but you can also look for the large Safeway grocery store on the right and the Chevron Gas Station on the left. The ferry landing is approximately 2.5 miles ahead from this intersection.</p>

    <dt class="kingbasil">FAQ üßê</dt>
    <dt>When should I get there?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>We‚Äôre still working out a full schedule of events, and you can click here to be notified when it‚Äôs up, but we‚Äôd advise you to get to the island the day before to get your bearings and to settle in. Ideally, you should plan to stay the weekend and island hop! All of the San Juan Islands are beautiful and worth exploring.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>What should I wear?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Semi-formal attire is ideal, but don‚Äôt stress too much! As long as you don‚Äôt wear a white dress, you‚Äôre probably fine. üòâ</p>
      <p>A few things to keep in mind: The wedding and reception will be on the lawn, so plan your footwear accordingly! Also, the island (and the Pacific Northwest in general) can get chilly when the sun goes down so you might want to bring a light jacket.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Do you have a registry?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Instead of a registry, we‚Äôre asking for donations to help us get to our honeymoon in Fiji! To donate, <a id="giftLink">click here</a>. Vinaka! (That means ‚ÄòThank you‚Äô in Fijian).</p>

    </dd>
    <dt>Do I need a car on the island?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>To be honest, you‚Äôll probably want one. Depending on where you‚Äôre staying, you‚Äôll want to be able to drive to the venue and back and use it to go into town, the beach, Mount Constitution, etc as the island isn‚Äôt super walkable everywhere. Keep in mind that rental cars on the island are extremely limited, so plan to rent one before taking the ferry if need be.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>How long have you guys been together?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Glad you asked! After talking for a month or so on Tinder (yes, Tinder!) we had our first official date on January 20, 2015 at the Portland waterfront, where I insisted he bring Subie along too. We‚Äôve been going strong ever since and can‚Äôt wait to see where this next chapter takes us!</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>Will there be food?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Yes, you will be fed! There will be appetizers and dinner as well as drinks. Oh, and cake, because what good is a wedding without cake?!</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>I heard there are farm animals...is that true?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Yes! Pebble Cove Farm is a working farm with chickens, goats and two pot-bellied pigs that you might spot during our ceremony!</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>You guys have a wedding hashtag don‚Äôt you.</dt>
